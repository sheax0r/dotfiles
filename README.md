# Dotfiles

OSX-specific dotfiles to do things that are useful to me, such as:
	* zsh stuff
	* vim stuff
	* ruby stuff
	* aws stuff

Based on [yadr](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) - this will pull down yadr, then do
extra stuff afterwards.

# Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sheax0r/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
rake all
```
